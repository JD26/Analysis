The script run_analysis.R works as follows:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set (*data*).
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (*df*).
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (*data1*)
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names (*"mean", "sd", "activity"*). 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (*data2*).
